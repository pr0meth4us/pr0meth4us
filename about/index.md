**Neron**

Suffered through 3 years of academic indecision, I'm almost graduating with dual degrees in IR and IT. After deep contemplation, real-world experience, and existential crises, I found my sweet spot in **Digital Governance**.

<ul class="list-disc pl-5">
  <li>I like IR and Politics because I like going down rabbit holes, and crafting policy solutions out of research.</li>
  <li>I code, not for fun or to innovate, but to solve my own minor inconveniences - giving myself temporary solutions to my temporary problems at my fingertips, which makes me feel like a god.</li>
</ul>
