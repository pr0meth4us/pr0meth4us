prometheus:
  Pr0meth4us was my choice for GitHub - not because I resemble the fire-stealing Titan in any meaningful way (except for the rebelliousness and defiance but for ungodly causes), but because I happened to be in my Oppenheimer obsession era. The original "Prometheus" username was unavailable, so Pr0meth4us with its strategic numbers became my identity.
