prometheus: >
  Pr0meth4us was my choice for GitHub - not because I resemble the fire-stealing Titan or he inspires me in any meaningful way 
  (aside from the rebelliousness and defiance, though for ungodly causes), but because I happened to be in my 
  Oppenheimer obsession era. The original "Prometheus" username was unavailable, so Pr0meth4us with its 
  strategic numbers became my identity. If anyone truly inspires me, it’s Niccolò Machiavelli, but more on that later.
