prometheus: >
  Pr0meth4us was my choice for GitHub - not because I resemble the fire-stealing Titan or he inspires me in any meaningful way 
  (except for the rebelliousness and defiance but for ungodly causes), but because I happened to be in my 
  Oppenheimer obsession era. The original "Prometheus" username was unavailable, so Pr0meth4us with its 
  strategic numbers became my identity.
